Back end route project that simulates a console and game rental store.

User can access multiple endpoints to create user login, regist address, rent and return games and consoles.

The project was carried out with the TypeORM tool, docker container, simulation of some tests with Jest, in addition to a confirmation email when the account is created. TypeScript and token validation are also implemented.

The project was deployed on Heroku. The project front-end was not implemented as the activity served as back-end training.

The application has a route system for renting, returning, confirming rental, registering users and addresses that can be checked in the routes folder.

Any further technical questions about the codes or the project, feel free to get in touch.

Thanks.
